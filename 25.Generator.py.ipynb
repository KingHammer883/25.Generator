    "\"\"\"Sentences in any language have a structure defined by a grammar. They also include a set of words from the vocabulary of the language. The vocabulary of a language like English consists of many thousands of words, and the grammar rules are quite complex. For the sake of simplicity our program will generate sentences from a simplified subset of English. The vocabulary will consist of sample words from several parts of speech, including nouns, verbs, articales, and prepositions. From these words, you can build noun phrases, prepositional phrases, and verb phrases. From these constituent phrases, you can build sentences. FOr example, the sentence \"The girl hit-the ball with the bat\" contains three noun phrases, one verb phrase, and one prepositional phrase.\"\"\"\n",

    "Its Constituents: Noun phrase + Verb Phrase, Article + Noun\n",

    "\t\t\t\t  Prepositional + Noun phrase.\t           \n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The rule for Noun phrase says that is an Article is followed by (+) a Noun. Thus, a possible noun phrase is \"the bat.\" Note that some of the phrases in the left column of Table 5-3 also appear in the right columns as contituents of other phrases. Although this grammar is much simpler than the complete set of rules for English grammar, you should still be able to generate sentences with quite a bit of structure.\n",

    "Of the many ways to solve the problem in this case study, perhaps the simplest is to assign the task of generating each phrase to a separate function. Each function builds, and returns a string that represents its phrase. This string contains words drawn from the parts of speech and from other phrases. When a function needs an individual word, it is selected at random from the words in that part of speech. When a function needs another phrase, it calls another function to build that phrase. The results, all strings, are concatenated with spaces and returned.\n",

    "The function for Sentences is the easiest. It just calls the function for Noun phrase and Verb phrase and concatenate the results, as in the following:\n",
